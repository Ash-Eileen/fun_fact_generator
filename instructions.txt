Fun Fact Generator
We will create a fun fact generator using gems! One you could use is is the ' ‘faker’ gem -> https://github.com/stympy/faker (Alternatively, browse for other gems at at RubyGems.org.) 

For this challenge, work on your local dev environment so that you will be able to install and use gems.

In your program:

Create a loop/method that will greet the user and ask if they want a fun fact

Use faker (or the gem of your choice) to display the fact, then ask the user if they would like another fact

If they want another fact, give them another one, else exit the app with a farewell message

Extra Challenge: 

Include another gem, such as colorize, to make your app super cool!!
